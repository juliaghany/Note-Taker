## Description 

My motivation for this project was to learn how to create an application that can be used to write and save notes, as well as uses an Express.js back end that will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. 

I built this project so that the user can write, save, view, and delete notes. I also built this project to gain more experience with Express.js. I was also able to get more experience with other NPM software packages such as path and fs during this challenge as well. 

I would like to note here that I forgot to make regular commits; once I changed my course of action I got a little carried away and forgot to commit my work as often as I should have.

## Usage

To use this application, begin by clicking the blue "Get Started" button on the homepage. Once you've done so, you will then be taken to the page where you will be able to write, save, view, and delete notes. To create a note, you can give it a title and begin writing the body of the note in the textbox below it. When you are done, in the top right corner you will find a save button. Clicking on that save button will save your note in the column to the left. If you'd like to view a previously written note, you may click on the title of the note in the left column and you will be able to view the entire note that you've selected in the right column. To delete a note, you can click on the red trash can icon to do so.

## Credits

- My instructor, Diego, helped me create a routes folder to hold seperate files that contained my html and api routes for this application. He helped me export them and import them to be used in my server.js file.
- My tutor, Alexis Gonzalez, helped me create the async funcion readData() in order to clean up my code. He also helped me rewrite my GET and POST routes to include that function. He helped me add error handling, and he helped me add the DELETE route.
- I referenced Module 11 Activity 1 for importing necessary node modules, as well as how to create my GET and POST routes for the html and for using the listen() method. 
- I referenced Module 11 Activity 22 (as well as received help from my instructor) for using modular routing.
- I referenced Module 11 Activity 22 6 for how to use query parameters (used for the DELETE route)
- I referenced Module 11 Activity 15 for setting up middleware for parsing application/json and urlencoded data. 
- I referenced this webpage for creating a unique ID for the notes: https://www.npmjs.com/package/uniqid
